All tubes you can buy are too small? You want big. And I mean really big? Than check out _BALOONR_! This two part 3D print tube has you covered. 

Make sure you print the parts sturdy and not weak. You will need to post-process your print for a smooth finish to have a comfortable fit. But most of all to have it water/airtight. I highly recommend using an epoxy coating. Also check out how to print water/airtight. 

Besides the printed parts you will need:
- 10x M5x15 socket head cap screw
- 10x M5 hex nuts
- 20mm x 3mm (1/2" X 1/4") adhesive foam tape (search for door weather stripping)

**Happy pumping and growing!**
